<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Career Cell aims to be IIT-B’s platform to provide our students with every bit of critical information about the plethora of career options , the myriad choices ahead of us and help us make a wise and informed career decision. As they commonly say “jñānaṃ paramam śaktihī — Knowledge is ultimate power”</p>
<p>
The three things that Career Cell stands by are – informed students, wise choice, and bright careers.<br>

Have you ever thought …..<br>
“What am I gonna do next – App or Job ? “<br>
“Which career do I take up ?”<br>
“Should I continue in Core or explore out finance ? “<br>
“How is it gonna be if I take up my passion for photography as a profession ?”<br>
“What’s going to make me happy at the end of the day?”<br>
“Will I be happy with little money and a better work satisfaction…or is money more important?!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These questions seem quite familiar and simple, don’t they ? But the answers to these are the least trivial and ironically of the utmost significance for our future, and that is where Career Cell comes into picture.</p>
