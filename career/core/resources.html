<div id="nrelate_flyout_placeholder"><p style="text-align: left;">We’ve all heard of it. Some of us dream of getting into it, thanks to the
impeccable reputation that the IAS has been able to build. You might be in a
dilemma as to whether to take the IAS route or go corporate. We, at The
Scholars’ Avenue attempt to mitigate this dilemma with this short overview
of the IAS.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Indian Administrative Services (IAS) is, simply put, the bureaucratic arm of the Indian government. Officers in the IAS hold major administrative
posts at the Centre or the State and are integral to the running of the nation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They are chiefly involved in civil administration at the macro as well asthe grass roots levels. They also act as the policy framers and decision makers of the government at various points in time, and on various levels. One could say that the position of the IAS officers in the government is crudely analogous to that of managers at different grades and degrees in a large organization.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How is the selection done?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Every year, the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) conducts the nationwide civil services examination for entry into a multitude of public services, most notably the IAS, the Indian Foreign Service (IFS) and the Indian Police Service (IPS). Recruitment for a slew of other Group A and Group B services such as Indian Revenue Service, Indian Audit &amp; Accounts Service, Indian Customs &amp; Central Excise Service, Indian Postal Service is also done through this examination. Any Indian citizen between 21 and 30 years of age with a valid Bachelor’s degree in any discipline from arecognized institution can apply. There are various relaxations for SC, ST and OBC sections.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Like any other popular entrance test, the civil services examination has a preliminary exam which is followed by a main exam. The main exam includes an interview round.The prelims comprise two papers with objective type questions, one in general studies (150 marks), and another (300 marks), in a subject to be chosen by the candidate from 23 varied options ranging from Electrical Engineering to Animal Husbandry &amp; Veterinary Science. The<br>
selection of an appropriate optional subject is crucial to doing well in the prelims. If one is screened through the prelims, one will have to face the mains – a set of nine subjective type papers, including a paper in a vernacular (to be chosen from a list of 18 languages) and one in English, which are purely qualifying papers. Further, there are two papers in general studies, two papers in each of two subjects to be chosen from a prescribed list of 51 optional subjects and an essay paper. Each paper is for 300 marks. except the essay which is for 200 marks. The final hurdle, the<br>
interview, is conducted by an interview board consisting of eminent persons from different walks of life. The interview again is for 300 marks, making a grand total of 2300 marks. A score of 1300 or above generally ensures entry<br>
into any public service. The exam is highly competitive, in that out of the four lakh odd people who appear for the prelims, only around 500 are finally selected, depending on &nbsp;the available vacancies in the various services. In<br>
order to gain entry into the IAS or the IFS which are the most in demand, one generally requires a &nbsp;position in the top 50.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>So, what happens next?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The selected candidates are assigned their respective services based on rank and preferences, much like the JEE counselling procedure. They are then made to undergo the reputed but unforgiving training program at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration in Mussoorie as probationary officers. This training is primarily academic in nature with subjects like political science, history, economics, etc. being taught extensively. At the<br>
end of this training, a hands-on training takes place. This is service specific and is conducted separately by each service. For All India Services like the IAS or IPS, the cadre system is followed. Each officer is randomly<br>
allocated a state cadre (the state he/she will be posted in). Personal preferences are taken into consideration if the candidate has proved to be exceptionally talented. The officer is thereafter identified as a servant of the state government of his/her state cadre. All officers start out as Junior Scale officers and are generally posted at the district level, as Assistant District Magistrates (or Sub-Collectors in some states). With time and experience, the officers are promoted according to merit, and can go up to as high as the level of Cabinet Secretary, the highest attainable post at<br>
the Centre.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How’s the work culture?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The work atmosphere is known to be rife with brazen corruption, excessive red-tape and unaccountability. Sometimes, the rigid hierarchical system leads to one feeling like a puppet in the hands of politicians and higher echelons. Often, an officer is made a scapegoat by the media and the politicians, in situations under the public eye. The Y K Alagh committee of 2001 called for immediate attention to these highly pertinent issues but failed to have any major impact.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Despite this, the job does carry with it immense power and as a result, commands a lot of respect. The job satisfaction is high, especially when working in the grass roots level. An additional feel-good factor that of being able to contribute to the development of the society at large.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How’s the money?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Though monetary remuneration is far below what you’d get in that plush corporate job that you could otherwise land, the perks are highly attractive and commensurate with the status of the post. The allowances and facilities that come along with the job more than make up for what you’d lose by saying no to a fat pay packet.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: left;">Other lucrative careers in the civil services</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">
</p><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Indian Foreign Service</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Officers in the IFS look after the country’s external affairs, including diplomacy, trade and cultural relations with other nations. Officers are posted either at the Indian Embassies in other countries or at the Centre and are responsible for their administration and activities. They are also responsible for formulating and implementing the government’s foreign policy. The highest post in this service is that of Indian Ambassador to another<br>
country.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Indian Police Service</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The IPS officers are the real life heroes who maintain law and order in the society. Apart from ensuring public safety and security, crime detection and prevention, traffic control and accident prevention, they are also responsible for ensuring the smooth functioning of the nation. The highest post in this service is that of Inspector General of Police (IG) of a particular state.</p>

      <div class="modal-body">
        <p>This article is an endeavour to bring forth the opportunities in the Indian Administrative Services, which for most of us stay hidden beneath the job profiles of finance, consultancy, analytics and many more.
    As IITians, we are considered to be a very talented lot. We are offered the best jobs with plenty of opportunity and incentives. Companies thrive on the IITian talent, and the individual grows at a steady pace. But then, what difference does our toil make to our country? To the people who stay on the roads, and have no water to drink?
    The profile of an IAS officer has the potential to make policies that affect millions of life. Your intelligence and talent can formulate the best possible policy for all social classes which after implementation would change the lives of many people including those who can’t even manage 2 meals a day.
    It is true that if you are an administrative officer, you are in a system that is corrupt and for many, frustrating. Then again, there have been many examples of IAS officers who have stood against dishonesty and consequently become media celebrities.  An honest and creative person can have a tremendous impact and leave his/her mark on the job.
    Civil Services is also a job opportunity that exists for us in India. Most students enter the job in their mid-20s, with some work experience, and various exit options. The Teach for India and social entrepreneurship trend has been picking up in the institute of late. We should consider Civil Services with the same enthusiasm.
    While there are some students preparing for IAS exams in the institute right now, some seniors who have gone down this road include Amit Arora, BS Raj Meena, Abhijit Bhole and Shaama Sharada.

<p><em>The following article was contributed by <a href="http://www.isid.ac.in/~dmishra" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.isid.ac.in']);"><strong>Prof. Debasis Mishra</strong></a> of the Indian Statistical Institute, New Delhi as part of a campus recruitment initiative for an Master of Science programme in Quantitative Economics. For a very well written paper on the subject by Prof. Mishra with illustrative examples from the real world, <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2067224/qe.pdf" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','download','http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2067224/qe.pdf']);" target="_blank">click here</a>.</em></p>
<h3>What is Quantitative Economics?</h3>
<p>Quantitative economics is a field of study where mathematics, in particular optimization, statistics, algorithms and complexity theory is used as a tool for analyzing and designing economic systems.</p>
<p>Quantitative economics is used in auctions to maximize bidders’ payoffs. Banking policies are based on fundamentals of quantitative economics and are covered systematically in macroeconomics and finance. Econometrics, which involves collecting appropriate economic data and analyzing it statistically, is a major component of quantitative economics because of its widespread applicability in government policies.</p>
<h3>MSQE at ISI Delhi &#8211; Course Structure</h3>
<p>ISI Delhi offers one of the best graduate programs in quantitative economics in India. The MSQE program is offered by the ‘Planning Unit’ department of ISI Delhi (<a href="http://www.isid.ac.in/~pu" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.isid.ac.in']);">http://www.isid.ac.in/~pu</a>). Some features of this program are:<em><br />
</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Curriculum:</em></strong> Courses are taught in microeconomics, macroeconomics, econometrics, game theory, finance, development economics, social choice and welfare, and many other advanced topics. A unique feature of all our courses is the focus on mathematical reasoning and analysis.</p>
<p><strong><em>Small batch size</em>:</strong> The batches in the MSQE program are only 15 strong. This ensures an excellent student to faculty ratio. Students from all backgrounds (pure science, engineering, economics and statistics etc) are encouraged to apply.</p>
<p><strong><em>Excellent placement:</em></strong> Campus placements are close to 95%. Employers typically include banks and financial institutions. One of the main attractions of the MSQE program is the opportunity to pursue further studies. Usually, half of the students in the course pursue doctoral studies at top universities like Columbia, New York University (NYU), CalTech among other US and European Universities.</p>
<h3>How to Get There</h3>

<p>An entrance test for the MSQE program is usually held in May every year. The entrance test is a one-day event with two papers. The first paper is on JEE-level Mathematics and the second paper on UG level Economics. Sample questions are available on the ISI website. A round of interviews follows for students selected on the basis of Entrance Test marks. For students who do not have a background of economics, scores in the Mathematics paper are emphasized.</p>
<p>Quantitative economics is an interdisciplinary field, linking economics with mathematics, statistics, and computer science. The analytical nature of this field makes it a worthy candidate for IIT undergraduates to consider it for higher studies. This opens up many career doors &#8211; in banking and finance, government policy, academics, consulting etc and hence makes for an interesting and rewarding experience on the road less taken.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
      <div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>PREREQUISITE</strong></div>
<p>Know the revised pattern; number and type of questions in both verbal and quant section, time allotted for each section and set, breaks during the exam, scoring pattern etc. before reading this article. The required information is present <a href="http://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/about/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/about/', 'here']);" >here</a>. Also, this article has been written specifically for verbal section.</p>
</div>
<div>Let&#8217;s get started right away.</div>
<div align="center"><strong><br />
CLARIFICATIONS</strong></div>
<div>1. Although the scoring has been changed to be out of 170 for each section, you won&#8217;t get your score out of 340 till after you finish your exam. The exam will give you a range of marks had you given the old pattern. For instance, after you finish your exam, the screen will show something like this:</div>
<div>Verbal : 580 &#8211; 680</div>
<div>Quantitative : 750 &#8211; 800</div>
<div>The exact score along with percentile will be reported depending on the date you are giving your exam. Details are present over <a href="http://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/scores/get/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/scores/get/', 'here']);" >here</a>.</div>
<div>2. Rumor has it that revised GRE has elements of sentence correction, grammar etc in its verbal section. If you have checked out the pattern, you would know that grammar is not required for verbal section.</div>
<div>3. As GRE people say, they have reduced the emphasis on pure vocabulary. This is true. However, it does not mean that you do not need vocabulary. Good GRE score still relies on a good vocabulary and doing wordlist is still a must.</div>
<div></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>TIPS AND TRICKS<br />
</strong></div>
<div>1. Give as many timed tests as possible. Do not get depressed if you are not able to write a good essay or not able to complete the verbal section for the first time. Take a test and contemplate on the shortcomings and do well on the next test.</div>
<div>2. Earlier, almost everyone used to do the vocabulary from Barron&#8217;s. Barron&#8217;s 19th edition (Barron&#8217;s book for new GRE), unfortunately, didn&#8217;t include any vocabulary. Get an older edition of Barron&#8217;s (18th or less) and do the vocabulary. Doing the wordlists at least ONCE would help a lot.</div>
<div>3. Now GRE doesn&#8217;t rely heavily on vocabulary. Therefore, from what I have noticed, out of the 3,500 words in Barron&#8217;s wordlist, about 1000 words are the one which are heavily used and learning only those words immaculately can fetch you a very good score in sentence completion and sentence equivalence questions.</div>
<div>4. The frequently used 1000 words are the one which represent some emotion or property of something (adjectives). The prominent properties being : to criticize, deceive, being sad, talkative, stubborn, etc. Whenever you encounter words which mean the same or the opposite or related to the ones represented above, writing them down would be a good idea. Losing marks on these prominent words would be carelessness.</div>
<div>5. Try and give all the practice tests at the same time as your GRE paper. It has two benefits :</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">a) It will help maintain your schedule. This is specifically important for people giving the test in the morning. Also, as GRE exam is about 4 hours long, you will get to know your endurance level.  Giving the tests at the same time will make you more adapted for GRE to that part of the day.</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">b) You will get to know more words which are used heavily. Almost all the tests are full of words which are used extensively by GRE makers. Practicing more and more questions will also serve this purpose.</div>
<div>6. After giving some tests, I personally found that skipping over comprehensions initially helped a lot. Completing all the questions except comprehension in 11-12 minutes, doing comprehension questions in 15 minutes and keeping about 3-4 minutes for reviewing questions used to be my aim.</div>
<div></div>
<div align="center"><strong><strong>GRE GUIDE BOOKS AND PRACTICE TESTS<br />
</strong></strong></div>
<div><strong>ETS OFFICIAL GUIDE</strong></div>
<div>This book is a MUST for now. It will give you detailed instructions on the new GRE and gives you a decent number of questions to practice and the strategy to handle each type of question. ETS people have explained the answers to all the practice questions and going through the explanations once would be a good strategy as it will really give you an insight on how to analyze questions and think along the lines of test makers.</div>
<div><strong>Tests</strong></div>
<div>It has 1 paper based test at the back of the book and 1 on the CD that comes with the book.</div>
<div>How to handle paper based test is at you discretion. It is different from computer based as for each set it gives you 25 questions for verbal in 35 minutes and 25 quant questions in 40 minutes which is not the case in computer based test. Detailed explanation of all the answers is present after the test. Taking it as untimed or timed practice test is your choice but I would suggest you to take it as timed test for obvious reasons!</div>
<div>The test on the CD is same as the one present on ETS website with the name <a href="http://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/powerprep2/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/powerprep2/', 'POWERPREP II']);" >POWERPREP II</a>. Giving POWERPREP II timed test is a MUST before taking the actual exam as it will familiarize you with the actual exam interface and the instructions. The questions are presented in the same format as would be in the real exam and the difficulty level on both the ETS test is closest to what you will experience during the exam.</div>
<div><strong>P.S.</strong> On page 133, they have given the math conventions. Quickly browse through them once as they give some clarifications which might not be very obvious.</div>
<div>This book is available on <a href="http://www.flipkart.com/books/0071074449" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.flipkart.com/books/0071074449', 'Flipkart']);" >Flipkart</a>.</div>
<div><strong>BARRON&#8217;S 19th EDITION</strong></div>
<div>This edition misses out on the content which had been the USP of Barron&#8217;s GRE guidebooks: wordlists. This book has decent no. of sentence completion exercise and very few comprehension questions but the number of tests offered offsets the shortcoming. This book has some good tips on writing essays and solving comprehensions. Rest of the tips are average. It&#8217;s not necessary that all the tips are useful. Use the ones you are comfortable with.</div>
<div><strong>Tests</strong></div>
<div>The book comes in 2 variants. One with CD and one without CD. You know which book you need to buy or arrange and from where you can get the CD. <img src="http://www.insightiitb.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /></div>
<div>The book has 2 sample tests at that end and 2 tests in the CD. The book tests&#8217; structure conform with the computer based test and it would be good to give them as timed tests. The CD test&#8217;s user interface is not same as GRE&#8217;s interface and there is no option of jumping back and forth while in the middle of a set. You can only do it once you reach the end of the set. Also, the graphs and the charts are not quite obscure in all the questions, whether on CD or on book. Do not get vexed and continue. In official GRE, they are appropriate and won&#8217;t be much of a problem.</div>
<div>CAUTION: The software in the CD is a faulty one. After you have completed a test, do not get disappointed by the marks. Software&#8217;s checking system is faulty. Also, if you try to jump to questions after finishing the test, the software hangs and you have to kill the process. To get around the problem, start the test again and this time start it as untimed test. Go to each question and see the correct answer and check all the answers yourself.</div>
<div><strong>Verbal difficulty level</strong> of the book is same as the original GRE.</div>
<div>This book is available on <a href="http://www.flipkart.com/books/8175156414" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.flipkart.com/books/8175156414', 'Flipkart']);" >Flipkart</a>.</div>
<div><strong>KAPLAN&#8217;S NEW GRE 2011-2012 : STRATEGIES, PRACTICE AND REVIEW</strong></div>
<div>This book has a good number of practice problems and some good tips on writing essays. Rest of the tips are average. Behind the book, you will find some material for learning words. Many of those words are high frequency words. There is also a section dedicated to word roots. Learning them will help you deduce meanings of many words.</div>
<div><strong>Tests</strong></div>
<div>At the end of the book, there is a test conforming with the computer based test and you get a unique ID with the book which you can use to take the online test. Although I found the test behind the book average and not up to the challenge, there is no harm in giving the test as a timed test. I couldn&#8217;t give the online test, so can&#8217;t comment on it.</div>
<div><strong>Verbal difficulty level</strong> of the book is a bit lower than the original GRE.</div>
<div>This book is available on <a href="http://www.flipkart.com/books/160714848x" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.flipkart.com/books/160714848x', 'Flipkart']);" >Flipkart</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div align="center"><strong><strong>PERSONAL REVIEW<br />
</strong></strong></div>
<div>The revised pattern definitely moves away from just vocabulary cramming but the multiple choice questions and sentence completion with 3 blanks (9 options!) maintain the test&#8217;s difficulty. The option of moving back and forth and marking questions for review is also helpful and should be used to the fullest. Giving as many tests as possible and developing a strategy accordingly is important.</div>
<div>Along with 2 predefined verbal sets, my experimental set was also verbal. In all the 3 sets, the structure was same. First 5-6 questions would be sentence completion, next 5-7 questions would be comprehension, followed by 4-5 sentence equivalence questions and then followed by 3-5 comprehension questions. This was the pattern I observed and should not be taken strictly.</div>

        <h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Exchange Stories</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
       <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Nothing can beat the four months I spent as an exchange student at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, be it in terms of the learning experience, the amazing people I got to meet or the crazy adventurous fun. It is remarkable how four months in a different educational setting can do wonders to your perspectives about everything around you. It was a mesmerizing experience from the day I landed in Singapore till the day I was forced to bid goodbye.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It all started when, soon after arriving, a couple of friends and I landed in an NTU Canteen without any vegetarian options. Since I was a vegetarian at that point (survival instincts later forced me to convert to a non-vegetarian lifestyle), Singapore and NTU seemed a total nightmare to me. But luckily, that was just one of the numerous canteens all over campus and I was able to find vegetarian food. I ended up converting to a non-vegetarian because there were no vegetarian stalls open after 9 pm. Food issues apart, I loved the facilities for students in NTU &#8212; to name a few, the sandwich and drink vending machines all around campus, the Xbox consoles and snooker tables in the student lounge, the air-conditioned study rooms and the printer facilities in hostels. I felt like I was living in a five-star hotel room, complete with RFID tags used for keys (something which totally astonished me &#8212; although there was a fine of 50 dollars if you lost it). A hut-shaped glass-walled TV Lounge stood alongside the grassy lawns next to my hall of residence, lending it the air of a resort. Luckily, I was allotted one of the newer halls of residence, and even had an air conditioner in my room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What I loved most about NTU was that most of the lectures were recorded (except tutorial rooms and seminar halls, all the lecture theatres have a central recording station, and lectures get uploaded within ten minutes of class getting over), and I had a lot of flexibility in making my schedule. I found the classes less mathematically intensive than those at IITM, but that could just be the exchange student in me talking. The number of electives available to students at NTU is much higher than that at IITM, with courses ranging from Communication Skills to Dancing to Theatre Skills to Field Sports. Another notable difference was in the grading &#8212; A+ and A both have the same score of 5.0, which seemed like a good thing to me. Perhaps even IITM could adopt such a system. I would say that the teaching quality there was pretty much the same as here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a points system in place for the full-time students, wherein you need to have a minimum number of points in order to secure a place in residence halls. You can get these points based on the distance of your house from the institute and by taking leadership roles in Hostel Welfare Unit or Co-curricular Clubs or staying with foreigners (for locals and vice versa). The bulk of these points come from leadership roles and this automatically puts emphasis on co-curricular activities &#8212; it would be great to have something similar in IITM too. I realized that soft skills are as important as academics, and proper emphasis needs to be given to this in IITM. My roommate was a Singaporean of Chinese descent, a workaholic but an extremely helpful and funny guy, and four months with him were a piece of cake. I met many Indian full-time students as well, apart from Singaporean students and exchange students (a whopping 600+ exchange students were in NTU for the semester), and it was a pleasure meeting each and every one of them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I, along with fifty other students from Asia, went there as part of the TF-LEaRN (Leadership Enrichment and Regional Networking) program, an extremely well-organized initiative. As part of it, we participated in several activities including community service, Leadership Forum and team projects (a book of memories, a video encompassing our exchange experience and the farewell event) along with several other networking events. The program also gave allowances to all the selected students, in order to ease the financial burden of being in one of the world’s most expensive cities. For community service, I gave tuition to visually challenged students which was quite an enriching experience. I wrote and compiled articles for the Memoir and was a performance manager for the farewell. Through these tasks I learned to respect cultural differences and also to appreciate different viewpoints. I had the pleasure of meeting some amazing people from all over Asia through this program and through participating in these activities, I made some wonderful friends as well. I would definitely recommend that juniors apply to this program in subsequent years for a lifetime’s worth of experience and learning, although now it is being offered during the odd semester (when I went, it was held in the even semester).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Singapore as a city is amazingly organized and most of the tourist attractions are on the famous Sentosa island. I loved the EZ-link card which pays for you on buses, trains, vending machines, as well as some shops. I had the pleasure of trying out Indian food at several places, with the best one being at a ‘pay as you wish’ buffet. Some of my friends dubbed the city as very artificial but it is simply too picturesque and well-maintained for me to complain about.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://t5e.iitm.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Photo4.jpg" rel="lightbox[11972]" title="Exchange Stories: When Singapore Called"><img class="wp-image-11974 aligncenter" alt="Holi in NTU" src="http://t5e.iitm.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Photo4.jpg" width="672" height="504" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other highlights of my stay included the extraordinary fireworks during the Chinese new Year event, trying alcohol for the first time, a trip to Bali (heaven for party and beach lovers), a skit performance during the Chinese new year celebrations on campus (the lyrics of ‘What does the fox say’ were changed to bring out the Chinese Zodiac story), joining the Toastmasters Club (a public speaking club), a small dance performance in traditional costumes during the farewell, Holi celebrations in a beach club and numerous trips all around Singapore. I loved the course projects as well but I’m not elaborating on them here. I learned a lot about different cultures and learned to think of things from a global perspective. Since exchange is not very common in IITM yet, to the students reading this, I’d like to say that you will definitely learn a lot by going on an exchange, and that I’d highly recommend TF-LEaRN and NTU.

		<h1>Life After B-tech - Arpan Badyopadhyay</h1><p>An undergraduate degree prepares you for many good jobs but there are many jobs like project leaders in industrial research divisions, university professor etc. that require advanced degrees. Research teams in the top industry think-tanks &amp; government labs consist primarily of people holding masters or doctorate degrees. The excitement of exploring the cutting edge of knowledge, and the thrill of your first research result, something you have discovered that no one else in the world knows, are worth savoring. These were the factors, which led me to take up my graduate studies at University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. The first year in any graduate program is all about courses. While most schools have the written of qualifying exams for PhD qualifying examinations within or after the first year, here you have to present your thesis proposal in front of a faculty panel followed by an oral examination testing your chemical engineering concepts and we need to do at least 10 courses within 3 semesters. But it’s more about learning and hardly about grades Advisor selection in graduate schools is tricky and probably the most ‘crucial’ decision of our life. Schools vary between having a rotation system (taking up short projects in about 3 different groups until you finalize 1) or where professors present their research and based on mutual consent, students decide on advisors, which was aptly quoted by one of my friends, as the ‘advisor dating’ process. UMN has the ‘advisor dating’ process where we need to meet at least 20 professors before finalizing on our advisor (so far I have only met 10 <img src='http://www.che.iitb.ac.in/chea/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' /> ). Actually, it’s good because you are exposed to the research going around in the department and I feel it is nice to be open to various research themes before deciding your advisor.</p>
<p>My experience in UMN has been excellent so far. I am completely awestruck by the cutting edge research going around here. My classmates include people from US, India, Greece, Turkey, Bangladesh and its always exciting to interact with them. The senior graduate students are there to help you out in every manner possible. The research infrastructure is simply excellent and most of the labs have there own TEM (you don’t have to be at the mercy of SAIF). Professors are extremely approachable, highly collaborative and are ready to co-advise on any project, which suits the interest of the students.The department here is very social. The first Friday of every month we have our round-tables (IIT counter part of happy hour) which is total fun. We have ‘ping pong’ championships where students and professors compete for the title with equal zest ,our HOD had been the champion for a long time and was recently defeated by one of the new professor <img src='http://www.che.iitb.ac.in/chea/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' />  .Talking about Minnesota without talking about the weather is incomplete. It is fall now and temperatures are already sub zero with no sign of snow yet. <img src='http://www.che.iitb.ac.in/chea/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' />  But the beautiful fall colors make up for it <img src='http://www.che.iitb.ac.in/chea/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Life of a graduate student is not necessarily like the one we read in PhD comics. It is all about learning and gaining skills, which come handy in career ahead, both academic and industrial setting. It is a common misconception that, PhD leads to academia. I’ve realized so far in UMN that the companies like are always on lookout for graduate students for their various research position openings. Companies even go to the extent of tracking/stalking students to offer them jobs. Hence, if students have an inclination for research, PhD is a surely a worthwhile investment.</p>

    How do you describe yourself as a person ? What were your interests , inclinations when you entered IIT ?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    After entering IIT , I didnt have any particular interests , I just planned to get a PhD or something after 5 years , so my inclination was towards
    research and the projects and interns that i undertook were all in one particular topic of chemical engineering , that was colloids and emulsions - I have
    done 2 projects in that topic . I liked to develop my resume in one direction , I was particular about entering into core engineering or do a PhD , I was
    not interested in going for a finance firm , hence i developed my resume for core field .
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    How did you zero in on the topic - emulsions and did you never have any doubts about your future plans , course of action ?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    After you study some of the courses , you get a basic idea about your inclinations. I liked mass transfer operations and hence i chose that field .
    Normally it will take you some time to know what you are interested in , but you must find out and focus on that thing . If you are interested in chemical
    , then core is a really good option , but if you are not interested in chemical , then you may try other options like finance , consultancy etc
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    Why did you chose a job over a PhD ?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    After two of my projects i really wanted to work and gain some ground experience, PhD is not off the table , I may opt for applying for a PhD after few
    years .
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    How did you choose the companies that you were planning to apply?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I was as i said interested in core , though core companies pay comparatively less than consulting or finance companies but what matters is the profile they
    are offering you . I chose companies on the basis of the job profile on offer .
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    Did you attend the PPTs and will you recommend them ?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I had to attend them because I was the placement team member , but to someone i will suggest that apart from the placement rules and policy, I would have
    preferred if i attended only the PPTs that interested me , like I didn’t want to attend the PPTs of consultancy companies because that’s a waste of time
    for me , hence I would suggest other people to focus only on the ones they are interested in .
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    What did you prepare for core companies ?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    For core companies you need a hold over your chemical engineering topics , I was also preparing for GATE , so I prepared keeping chemical topics in
    perspective rather than companies in perspective . So i prepared keeping chemical topics and then chose companies which interested me .
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    How did you prepare your resume ?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    While preparing for resume , I suggest that you should only include the things that are your strong areas and which you are good at . While in IIT you do a
    lot of things , but don’t include all of those things . So I did more than 4-5 interns but I included only the ones which I was certain about . I have done
    an intern in Bhabha Atomic Research Center , and I was pretty confident about it , so I included that one , not all of them .So only include the points
    that are highlights in your personality . You should only include the things that you think you can answer satisfactorily in an interview .
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    How did you prepare for HR Questions and GDs ?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    For GDs we prepared together in our wing , so the whole of wing used to sit with one person as the moderator who used to decide a topic and we had a vivid
    debate over the topic , that was a really awesome way to prepare for the GDs . Since I was in the Placement Team , I had some bit of experience in talking
    and dealing with HRs . Even here , wing was really helpful , one of my friend became the HR who interviewed me and vice versa .
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    What should be kept in mind while signing a JAF ?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    There are many things to be kept in mind , firstly the job profile - you must choose the job that interests you rather than the one that pays more or
    you’ll end up getting frustated while in job . Second is the place where you are placed - are you comfortable with the city et all ? Thirdly , do you like
    the work culture of the company ? You can judge the work culture in the PPTs , one of the advantages for turning up for them .

    What was the shortlisting criteria for Cadbury ?</b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            Resume shortlisting on basis of CPI,technical background and a little emphasis on POR(leadership roles)
        </p>
    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            GD was based on a very generic topic for a group of 10 people ( Taking the lead role did not matter here, ideas and innovative thinking were
            evaluated)
        </p>
    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            Interview consisted of a single round comprising of HR+Technical - Both needed to prove your leadership capability, team management and technical
            expertise
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    Which other companies did you apply for ? what was the shortlisting criteria for those companies</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Most of the companies that I applied for were the Core companies-mostly having a profile where the technical knowledge in Chemical engineering could be
    used. Again, all used the criteria by shortlisting through a Test(technical) followed by a GD on generic topic and finally one round of interview on Core
    topics in Chemical engineering.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    How many people were made offers ?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    One from each department , chemical , mechanical and civil
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    Can you walk us through the interview ?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Most of the questions were based on the resume , about interns , BARC , and other technical stuff . Then they wanted to know why I should be selected and
    given the job offer ? They also asked about my courses , one of the interviewer asked many questions about plant design operations .
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    How important are things like personality , etiquettes et all for a core company ?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    It depends from company to company , some companies are really strict about the clothes etc while some are not . It matters more for non-core companies
    like consult and finance which give a lot of stress on how a person dresses , behaves etc during the interview . Core companies do give some weightage but
    it is not the essentially important thing .
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    What were the essential traits that they were looking in you ?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    My core knowledge and leadership skills .
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    How did they check the leadership skills ?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    So in the interview , they made me the leader and themselves as the employees and created a whole scene where I have to convince the “employees” to work
    properly and efficiently .
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    How did you feel once the placement season was over ?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    It really feels relaxed , calm and free .
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    In retrospection what do you think could have been done better ?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Well after attending many PPTs , I started to develop some interest and liking for consultancy . So i wasted some time for case studies and all , which i
    didn’t opt in the end . So I really think that time could have been used better , I advice all to really focus while in the placement season
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    What will you advice to a person placed in cadbury ?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    It all depends on your technical , leadership skills .
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    What will your final message be to the Placement Junta in general ?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Resume should reflect your personality , prepare the resume as good as you can . Highlight only the points which you can defend really well . Practice
    really hard and gain the confidence in the field which you have opted . Plan it properly , people in IIT have the habit to do everything at the eleventh
    hour which doesn’t provide the necessary confidence needed in interviews .

            Believe me guys; I have seen my batch mates not getting the job just because even after doing every other thing right they were not able to defend
            that particular single point of their resume. Having said that, some of the points can be written in a better form to portray some different
            qualities (conveying the same work).

    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            Be careful in what you write about your second year internships. People tend to write many fancy words and could not defend in the end.

</p>
<ol>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            It is important to attend PPTs of all the companies relevant for you. You can always pick out things from the PPT to answer questions like why do
            you want to join our company? ; Why do you think we should hire you? ; What is so unique about us as compared to competitors?
        </p>
    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            Take notes during PPTs. At least note down what is unique about that company? ; What are the qualities they are looking for in a candidate? These
            things help on the interview day when one does not have enough time to go to the internet. One can just look at the notes and frame answers of some
            standard HR questions.

   <b> ITC Process</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Resume Shortlist (30 mech + 30 Chem + 20 elec), followed by case-based GD (20 minutes) shortlist of around 30 followed by 2 interviews (mix of both
    technical + HR). 9 people were made final offers, 8 joined in the end.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Note: Please do not have the mindset that only high CPI students can crack ITC. One needs to have a decent CPI to get shortlisted. After that, it all
    depends on GD and PIs. Out of the 8 students who joined ITC this year from IITB, 4 of them had CPI in the range of 8 to 8.2. So, don’t just drop this
    company from your target list without giving much thought.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    <b>Group Discussions</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    ITC always has case based GDs. Most of you guys would have experienced this in your 3rd year also. Generally, they come up with the same standard cases
    (This year may not). But, I will advise you to contact 3rd year students after they have their GDs during internship selection process to get the flavor of
    the cases. All the standard fundae of GDs are applicable here also, which you will hear from a lot of people in due course of time.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    <b>Interview</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I had 2 interviews each of around 45 minutes. Both can be divided into 3 phases (Normal HR + Technical + Not so normal HR).
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    One thing is for sure, Expect anything in an ITC interview. Each of us had different type of experiences. Therefore, a lot depends on how well you answer
    the very first question, tell me about yourself. If you are able to justify this answer in the interview, I think you will be in. So, prepare this answer
    well.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Select three qualities of yourself that you would like to tell the interviewer. Keep some examples or stories ready to back them. At the same time, be
    ready with the 4th thing that you don’t like about yourself (basically a weakness).
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    If you try to portray yourself as someone who is in deep love with chemical engineering, then be ready to answer some chemical engineering fundamentals.
    Those who are genuinely in love with chemical engineering should not hesitate at all and earn some brownie points.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    <b>Technical</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Be ready to be grilled on all the technical stuff that you have in the resume especially the internships and technical projects.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Go through reports and PPTs that you have made in your internship period. Find out the current status of the project you have done. Business aspect of your
    project should be clear to you.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Prepare one or two courses very well. They sometimes ask which your favorite course is and then accept you to answer all the questions.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Refer to a mail sent by Pratik Behra for the core preparation strategy. Ask dual degree batch for the same.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Bottom line is if you claim something in the interview , you must be able to back it up .
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    <b>Human Resources</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    HR is a very crucial part of ITC interview process. You must spend a good amount of time in preparing for the normal HR questions. Two resources are:
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    o 64 HR questions
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    o HLPQ (available on DC)
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Google yourself, look into various aspects of your life, pin them down. Do not wait for the last week for HR preparation. You may not be able to sit in
    peace in the last week.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    In case you have multiple shortlists in the same slot, be ready to defend yourself when they ask what your preference is.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    They will ask you about your higher study plans. Be diplomatic in answering such questions.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Some value based HR questions can be asked. There may be questions on ethical issues related to cigarettes.

<p dir="ltr">
    <b>Did you attend Pre-Placement talks? Did you gain anything out of them? Did you talk to anyone else about choosing between jobs/companies?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Yes I did attend PPTs and I learned where I dont want to go like analytic or banks. Talked to seniors, parents and profs.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    Any website/material you read/used for preparation of Case-Studies/HR Questions/Puzzles/Technical/GDs? (Your sending across links/documents would help us
    compile a single point resource)</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Course material since 1st year, Wikipedia and other related websites to prepare for core.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    For interview/GD/Test preparation did you prepare in groups or individually? Which one do you think helps the most? Any details you provide will be of
    great help.</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Both are required.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    What was the procedure of selection? Roughly how many people were short listed at each level? And how many were made final offers?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    In DRDO they had a test which was easy and then it was interview. It was completely technical interview. Around 7-8 senior scientists from DRDO where
    sitting around the table and asking questions from different areas related to my branch. Not a single HR question.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    Walk us through the GDs/Interviews of this company. The questions that you were asked and other details that you may remember would be of great help.</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    As mentioned in last point. Interview was totally technical. They asked small small things since first year. So a good preparation since 1st year will help
    a lot in preparing for DRDO or any core job.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    If someone wants to appear for this company, what all should he/she ideally prepare?
</b></p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Everything whatever he/she has studied since first year.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    What was the procedure of selection in the other companies that you were shortlisted in? What all happened in your GD/Interviews? Anything you remember
    would be of great help.</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Opera Solution interview. Was not of my area of interest and my profile was not according to their requirement. So bad interview. In that interview I
    realised I dont want to go to non core but I want to get in to DRDO.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    Your key learning from these experiences? What mistakes did you commit?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    No answer
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    Any key tips for the interview-day?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Just be your self. They need good people as much as you need good company. So have a faith in your self and just do it. Placement is gamble dont take it
    too seriously. Things dont have according to plan. Ready for the surprises and fight for a job that you would like to do and not just they are paying large
    amount of money.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    Any other questions which could be useful for the students?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Before any interview just ask one question to yourself that why do I want to have this job? Or do I really want this job?
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    How did you prepare your resume? Any help/material you took/read?</b>

<p dir="ltr"><b>
    Did you attend Pre-Placement talks? Did you gain anything out of them? Did you talk to anyone else about choosing between jobs/companies?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Yes, I attended many of them! They were helpful in finding out the type of job and see whether that's interesting to me or not.

<p dir="ltr">
    Most of the things are available on dc++ and fundae were quite known.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    http://www.shldirect.com/en/practice-tests
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    I found this website useful for many general aptitude-verbal tests.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    For interview/GD/Test preparation did you prepare in groups or individually? Which one do you think helps the most? Any details you provide will be of
    great help.</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I prepared in groups. It is extremely important to practice mock interviews and GD well before placements, it's not possible to practice it during
    placements.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    What was the procedure of selection? Roughly how many people were short listed at each level? And how many were made final offers?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    In Credit Suisse, the shortlisting was based on test which comprised of statistics including probability and puzzles. Around 10 were shortlisted and
    2-offers were made as far I remember.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I was not sure of getting shortlisted and so didn't prepare for the interview well before which resulted in bad interview. Had I considered the
    shortlisting before, I could have cracked it.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    Walk us through the GDs/Interviews of this company. The questions that you were asked and other details that you may remember would be of great help.</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Yeah, don't remember the exact questions! There were some questions from basic probability (IC-102 course) and then there was a puzzle based on the concept
    of expected value which I could not solve completely.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    If someone wants to appear for this company, what all should he/she ideally prepare?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Basic probability, Distribution functions (Normal distribution, gaussian, binomial etc.), Hypothesis testing, Residuals etc. See Book by Sheldon Ross.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    What was the procedure of selection in the other companies that you were shortlisted in? What all happened in your GD/Interviews? Anything you remember
    would be of great help.</b>

<p dir="ltr">
    No answer.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    Your key learning from these experiences? What mistakes did you commit?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    If you don't want to take risk, practice as much as you can.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    Any key tips for the interview-day?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Be confident in the interview! You should show your interest in the company during the interview.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    No answer.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><b>
    How did you prepare your resume? Any help/material you took/read?</b>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    -Gather all information
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    -Make a large resume
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    -Shortlist relevant contents
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    -Frame proper sentences and wordings
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    -Keep revising
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    That's generic thing any one does and so I also did. The key part is revising and student should keep looking at different formats of resume and try to
    categorize the resume in relevant 3-4 parts. Every part can have a suitable format..for example for a project: Aim/objective, actions, results/key
    learnings.

        <h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Why Study Abroad? from MIT</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        <p dir="ltr">
    Name: Nishanth Dikkala
    <br/>
    Currently pursuing a PhD in an area which is an overlap of algorithms, economics and machine learning at MIT.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Why higher studies?
    <br/>
    There are many reasons why people opt for higher studies, the typical ones among them being,
</p>
<ol>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            Desire to gain more expertise into the chosen field -&gt; can lead to better jobs, going into academia.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            Desire to study/settle outside India -&gt; experience some of the best education systems across the world
        </p>
    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            Haven’t really figured out what to do next. Think getting a Masters degree would be a nice addition to resume. (going for a PhD just because you
            haven’t figured out what to do next doesn’t happen usually)
        </p>
    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">
            Desire to do research which is innovative and impactful, desire to explore the depths of a field and add to the ocean of human knowledge (takes a
            long time, probably won’t happen while in grad school)
            <br/>
            <br/>
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">
    Irrespective of what reasons one might have students pursuing higher degrees develop the skill to think critically and the ability to solve real-world
    problems for which answers are not known, and perhaps also the ability to recognize interesting and important problems in a field. All these skills can be
    immensely useful in any career.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Why study in USA?
    <br/>
    USA has some of the world’s best institutes with the world’s best minds working in these institutes. US attracts talent from all over the world and hence
    the world leaders in many fields are located at US universities. This applies to all fields in general. The opportunity to work with such people is a
    strong motivator for people to come study in the US.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Although culturally different, Indians have been living in the US for many generations now and seem to have lesser trouble adapting as compared to some
    other countries such as European ones. English being the prime language of communication also helps.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    US universities offer a distinct international culture. At MIT, the percentage of international students is as high as 50%. This includes people from
    various countries and leads to a rich cultural diversity and creates for a uniquely broadening, although sometimes challenging, learning experience, one
    which will be an asset for any career.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    In a world where entrepreneurship is gaining more and more importance, USA is a leader on this front. US universities heavily encourage entrepreneurship
    (via mentoring, funding etc). They provide a really good platform for students to make use of. Some of the startups in computer science that have come out
    of universities in US are Google (Stanford), Dropbox (MIT), Akamai (MIT).
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    Beyond all the above points, one thing US universities are especially good at is networking. These people know how to network. By studying at such
    universities, students automatically become a part of such incredible networks and have easy access to experts in their fields.
