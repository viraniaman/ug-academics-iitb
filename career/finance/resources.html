      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
<p>For every Jobs (Apple) there is a Donald Trump (The Trump Organization), Sheryl Sandberg (Facebook), Warren Buffet (Berkshire Hathaway) and closer to home, Anand Mahindra (Mahindra &amp; Mahindra). While the list of the former cluster may dwindle, that of the second lot, armed with an MBA from a top school, continues to swell.</p>
<p>Child prodigies like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg are rare and difficult to cultivate using traditional education methods – ask Harvard, they tried! If you believe you belong to their tribe, I urge you not to read ahead. However, if you, like me, believe you have academic prowess and more importantly have the drive to create impact, read on.</p>
<p>Why do you need an MBA if you want to be an entrepreneur?</p>
<p>This question tops the list of FAQ’s as students embark on their exploratory journey towards higher education and begin evaluating an MBA.</p>
<p>I am a Harvard Business School graduate and founder of a boutique admissions advisory, ReachIvy. Two years at business school made me dismiss any doubts I had about the efficacy of an MBA, given the high costs and time invested in it.</p>
<p>First, the cultural experience is unprecedented – one really gets to experience a ‘flat-world’. My home aptly has the moniker of an international hostel, as friends stop by from across the globe. Also, I believe that a lot of learning happens during travels. Most top Business schools organize trips to various parts of the world to learn from first-hand cultural and professional experiences.</p>
<p>Moreover, at school I had access to some of the finest minds in the world. Noble prize laureates and industry experts made up the faculty and the diversity of classmates was baffling. As Dr. Dipak Jain, former dean at Insead, mentioned at a ReachIvy event, “Having global experience is a necessity and an entry barrier to top schools. Hence, the difference is the quality of classmates. When you are at Stanford, Princeton, all of them are so brilliant.” Learning from other classmates who started their businesses is an asset when starting your own entrepreneurial venture. I had access to an eclectic mix of experiences and got a deep insight across several industries and functions in the short span of two years.</p>
<p>It is well established that an MBA is not a required pre-requisite to start a firm.  However, most are not aware that business schools provide tremendous aid and resources as one embarks on this arduous journey. Faculty, students, investors and industry experts help you ideate further, making the foundations of your business model almost water tight. You can examine various business models and experiment within the safety walls of the school by participating in the myriad B-plan competitions hosted on several campuses. For instance, Wharton has a business plan competition, venture initiation program, entrepreneur in residence program, Wharton entrepreneurial program and other resources to support budding entrepreneurs. Similarly, other top schools have a robust support system to help ambitious individuals in starting their companies.</p>
<p>Lastly, the professional network that I became a part of is colossal. At ReachIvy’s Speaker Series, LBS alum Pratik Agarwal, VP corporate Strategy at Vedanata Resources rightly points out “In a business that I started I found that one of my potential customers who runs one of the largest broadband businesses is actually a classmate of mine.” Similarly, my professional network is very supportive when I reach out to them; I always get a response.</p>
<p>It has now been four years since I graduated; I continue to appreciate and understand the value of my degree everyday – and this is just the beginning.</p>

        <h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">CFA Simplified</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
<p>In recent times, there has been an obvious shift towards finance as a career from engineering &#8211; perhaps due to the industry’s compensation structures as well as opportunities for quick thinking and interacting with the senior management. So for finance enthusiasts, CFA is the new buzz word.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What is CFA?</strong></p>
<p>The Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Program is a graduate level self study program offered by the CFA Institute to those interested in investment and financial professions. Its syllabus is guaranteed to make the candidates well informed and is internationally recognised. While the main focus is on portfolio management and financial analysis, it brushes through the other areas of finance as well. Most financial institutions consider the CFA charter to be a symbol of professional excellence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Exam Structure and Syllabus</strong></p>
<p>In order to participate in the CFA program, “a candidate must hold or be in the final year of a university degree, or have 4 years of qualified, professional work experience in an investment decision-making process.”<br />
The program is spread across 3 levels. The fee structure varies with the CFA program curriculum, i.e., eBook only, print only, or both. The enrolment fee and the exam registration fee increase with each deadline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Level I</span><br />
The first paper is based on multiple-choice with approximately 240 questions and a time limit of 6 hours, split into two 3-hour sessions. It focuses on tools and concepts that apply to investment valuation and management. The prerequisites for this level include a Bachelor&#8217;s degree or equivalent, obtained no later than the 31st of December of the year in which the first exam will be written. The exam is held during the first weekends in June and December and the results are declared within 60 days. The passing rate for this round is about 35-40%. The fee, usually unkind on students’ pockets, ranges from $1,070 to $1,470.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scholarsavenue.org/uploads/2011/11/cfalevel11.gif" ><img class="size-full wp-image-6785 aligncenter" title="cfalevel1" src="http://www.scholarsavenue.org/uploads/2011/11/cfalevel11-e1321091093857.gif" alt="" width="388" height="320" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Level II</span><br />
The second exam is similar to the first with multiple choice questions to be attempted in 6 hours. It mainly deals with asset analysis. The second level is held in the month of June only and results are usually provided within 90 days. Around 40% of the candidates pass this level.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scholarsavenue.org/uploads/2011/11/cfalevel2.gif" ><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6786" title="cfalevel2" src="http://www.scholarsavenue.org/uploads/2011/11/cfalevel2.gif" alt="" width="432" height="288" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Level III</span><br />
The final level comprises of 120 multiple choice questions as well as an essay, with equal importance to both and a total time of 6 hours is provided   . The exam explores portfolio management in great depth. The requirements are a passing grade in Level 2 and 3 years of professional work experience. One must demonstrate a working knowledge of the portfolio management process, from calculating investor constraints, objectives, and capital-market expectations to making asset-allocation decisions. The exam is conducted in June and results are declared within 90 days. 45% of the candidates clear this level.<br />
It typically takes a minimum of 4 years to complete the CFA Program.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scholarsavenue.org/uploads/2011/11/cfalevel3.gif" ><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6787" title="cfalevel3" src="http://www.scholarsavenue.org/uploads/2011/11/cfalevel3.gif" alt="" width="418" height="324" /></a><strong> </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CFA vs. MBA</strong></p>
<p>While most websites harp on about the syllabus being very similar to a Masters in Financial Management, our alumni still feel that one cannot substitute for the other. A PGDM from an IIM or the ISB would guarantee you a better placement and a more thorough understanding of the subject. An MBA from a B-school abroad is beyond comparison, they say.<br />
“An MBA is required to spur your career. Time it well. And while you wait for that time – enhance your knowledge with CFA”, says a 2006-graduate who, having completed all 3 levels, is now going to continue working for a couple of more years before going for a foreign MBA. There are few who opt for substituting an MBA with the CFA degree, citing time-saving to be the advantage.<br />
As far as an alumnus who recruits B-school grads, is concerned, nothing beats a class-room education and formal recognition from a good university.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why CFA?</strong></p>
<p>The publicly touted reason is that the CFA charter is one of the most highly respected and valued qualifications recognised internationally. It is a representation of your professional competency.<br />
While most students on our campus cite CV-building as the primary reason and a fresh curiosity about Finance as the secondary motive, the alumni we spoke to, have a little more to add.<br />
One at Deutsche Bank says that having the most comprehensive and vast self-study syllabus available gives you an overview of a broad gamut of the various fields in finance in a lucid manner. A CFA qualification usually gets you into the buy-side of the finance-based careers as the syllabus with every increasing level shifts more towards Investment Analysis and Portfolio Management. Another recent alumnus adds that as most banks sponsor the exam and aggressively encourage their employees to become CFA charter-holders, there isn’t any financial burden on the candidate and complete support from the work-place eases the process of balancing work and study. Other alumni contributed, saying that even though they are pursuing Masters in Management or Finance, they find the syllabus helpful because it covers all topics breadth-wise and not in-depth. “Completing the 3 levels of CFA via self study shows perseverance, adds tremendous value to your CV and does aid in your chances of a bonus or hike in salary”, says another alumnus who has recently acquired the charter.<br />
When speaking to our peers across the IIT campuses, we came across a similar trend. More than 50 people in our own campus and a similar number in IIT-B have attempted the CFA Level-1. The CFA-bug has also spread to Delhi and Madras. “It’s not really a differentiating criterion anymore. Everyone serious about finance clears the first level before graduating”, says a recent IIT-B graduate who says that the qualification helped him get a Masters in Finance despite having an engineering background. Other students say that clearing the first level is more than enough for you to understand if your interests lie in the area or not. They say that not all finance-based companies value the charter enough to sponsor you and cite financial restrictions as the reason for not completing the course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bottom line:  if you are interested in learning finance, have heavy-enough pockets and have nothing better to do with your time here – CFA might just be the answer for you.</p>

        <h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">What were your experiences like while doing MBA in top US universities like Stanford Harvard after IIT</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">

        <p>I had the good fortune of obtaining an MBA at Harvard Business School (HBS) after a B-Tech at IIT Madras. Without a doubt, both were great experiences.<br /><br />I will try to answer the questions using both my experiences and those of others I know about. I don&#039;t want to get into specifics since I don&#039;t think it will be helpful and rather will try to answer the questions in a way that will be useful for potential candidates. Also note that while I am highly biased by my HBS experience, I do have friends from other B-schools and hence have tried to be a little more generic.<br /><br />How tough was the application process? <br />I would say it is a tough application process. Official acceptance ratio is ~10% for these B-schools, which is low but not as low as JEE or CAT (&lt;1%). Adjusting for people who don&#039;t apply because they consider the process too long or costly or (rightly/wrongly) too tough to get in, the acceptance ratios would be similar. <br />A good application involves a good academic record (school/ undergrad/ GMAT), good work experience/resume and good extra curricular experience (not necessarily social work, as is common belief). One needs to spend 1-2 months writing the essays for the application and choosing the right recommenders. All said and done, you require in equal amounts a good application and good luck to get in.<br /><br />How did you manage the expenses for tuition and living? <br />Many colleges provide some form of scholarship, especially for tuition. I think ~30% is the average IIRC. There are other external scholarships as well more specific to the schools you apply to and the background you come from. Most schools have a facility to provide loans for the remaining amount at reasonable (but not low) rates. And you could also take a student loan in India though preferably not given interest rates.<br />Note that B-school life is usually ostentatious and filled with many trips and events you would find hard to justify except for peer pressure and &quot;once-in-a-lifetime&quot; experiences. <br /><br />How much did it cost you for two years? <br />Cost before any form of scholarship was $80-100K per year, of which $40-45K is tuition. The official budgets are available in each school&#039;s web page. Could be higher if you are the party type ;)<br /><br />What did you learn from there? <br />Oh man, tough question. I don&#039;t want to bore too much here so the short version is that I learnt about a lot of different people, countries, ideas, philosophies, academic concepts, work experience, work opportunities, social events and social customs. Overall, I think you learn a lot about what you don&#039;t know, which differs a lot for each person.<br />I made some friends who I hope will be close friends for times to come. I got to know some professors who I hope to interact with and learn from for times to come. I think it was a lot about the people for me.<br /><br />How different is the education from IITs? <br />Quite different. The case method in HBS was disconcerting at first because it forces one to speak more often and, more importantly, to be comfortable with speaking without thinking through your thoughts fully. The ability to take (good) decisions without full information and without much time is the focus here, I think.<br />I think the education at IITs, and engineering in general, focuses on right answers versus at HBS, the education focuses on multiple viewpoints and the advantages or disadvantages of the same since there is often no right or wrong in business (apart from illegal, of course).<br /><br />Finally, did you pursue your interests or take a job like placements in IIT to recover the amount spent?<br />I pursued my interests and took a job at campus placement :) (I did the same in IIT). I think bulk of students took a job but a few also started up their own venture (~10%). This answer will depend on the school - the ratio of startups will be much higher at Stanford, I guess.<br /><br />Hope this was useful!

        <h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">What are the pros and cons of doing an MBA in one of the IIMs just after passing out of IIT</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">

        <p>The upside is that you can fast-track into a Big 3 consulting (McK, BCG, Bain) or a bulge-bracket investment banking role. You can, in theory, get these jobs straight after IIT, but that is much harder simply because the IIT job market is more competitive. The supply-demand dynamics at IIMs are much more favorable to job-seekers.&nbsp; <br /><br />On the downside, the MBA is largely wasted on you. You&#039;ve never worked in an organization before, and most classes will not make any sense in any deep way. I treated my MBA as an advanced math degree, choosing the majority of my electives in mathematical finance, statistics, econometrics etc. I partially regret this. Also, despite everything the brochures will tell you, the IIMs are hardly hotbeds of diversity - (just about) everyone has the same gender (male), the same background (engineer), the same ambitions (lots of money).<br /><br />I would say that by attending an IIM straight after IIT, you&#039;re really betting that a) there will be a reasonable number of &quot;big jobs&quot; when you graduate and b) you will be one of the students that crack the &quot;big jobs&quot;, while acknowledging that c) your expected level of learning is going to be very low.&nbsp; Point (a) largely is a bet on the macro-economy two years down the line. Point (b) refers to your intrinsic quality, with the knowledge that if you made into one of the top IIMs without any work experience, you&#039;re likely very good (owing to the focus now on admitting mostly experienced folk). Point (c) is just a fact of life.
