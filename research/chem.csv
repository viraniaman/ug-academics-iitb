The three-dimensional structure enables us to visualize protein structures at the atomic level and enhances our understanding of protein function, how they undergo conformational changes, and how they perform catalysis. Armed with this information we can design novel drugs that target a particular protein, or rationally engineer an enzyme to find cures for specific diseases.

A. Q. Contractor,"During the past few years concerted efforts are being made to utilize the remarkable properties of conducting polymers to develop new technologies in collaboration with colleagues in the institute. Thus, a new generic concept for a biosensor has been proposed exploiting the potential and pH dependent conductivity of polyaniline. (This work was described in C&EN, 70(46), 16, 1992) This concept has been used to develop sensors for glucose, urea, triglycerides and hemoglobin. A biosensor array -- electronic tongue -- has been produced to assay glucose, urea and triglycerides simultaneously from a few m l of sample. The concept has recently been extended to use polyaniline to detect the binding of a guest to a macromolecular host. This has resulted in a molecular electronic switch responsive to metal ions. The device can detect K+ ions in aqueous solutions at ppb levels.",http://www.chem.iitb.ac.in/~aqc/,chem,,
