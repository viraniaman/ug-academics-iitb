Prof. Asim Tewari,"My research interest 
                              encompasses the above length scales to 
                              mathematically model structures and study 
                              materials response and behavior. Specifically, my 
                              research deals with the sub field of 
                              microstructural-mechanics. Microstructural-mechanics 
                              is a modern equivalent of traditional mechanical 
                              metallurgy. It combines the computational methods 
                              of structural mechanics and materials sciences in 
                              a framework defined by heterogeneous materials 
                              microstructure. The success of the above 
                              methodology depends on the mathematical 
                              representation of the materials microstructure. 
                              This becomes particularly more challenging since, 
                              in spite of recent advances in microscopy (SPM, 
                              EBSD, etc.), the microstructural characterization 
                              is limited to 2D surfaces whereas the true 
                              microstructure is three-dimensional in nature. 
                              Thus a main thrust of my research is in 
                              deconvolution of true three-dimensional 
                              microstructure by combining data from various 2D 
                              characterization techniques. This involves study 
                              of mathematical relations on the intersection of 
                              d-dimensional planes through objects in hyperspace 
                              and arrangement & tiling of objects in space. 
                              This is achieved by a combination of integral 
                              geometry, measure theory and mathematical 
                              morphology. It is complemented by high-resolution 
                              microscopy and computer modeling.",http://www.asimtewari.com/,mech
