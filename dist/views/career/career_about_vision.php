		Most of the students who come to IIT imagine engineering to be something while it turns out to be completely different. 
		Some are here because of some peer pressure from the society or parents, while there real interest lies somewhere else.<br>
		Career Cell believes that a student must choose a career where his heart lies or he is really interested in, then only the person will be completely satisfied in life.  Keeping this vision in mind Career Cell, the career guidance wing of the Academic Council, helps the students get guidance for the career option they are interested in by organising various activities like Career talks, Workshops, Online forums, Summer and Winter School and many more. Such activities also help students who are confused about choosing their career option.
