				Project ID: STCS1102<br>

				Project Name: Analyze surveillance video for people traffic<br>

				Background:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;

				Bravo Lucy creates decision products that use machine learning and 

				econometrics practices, which help businesses, make informed decisions.

				One area of interest is providing additional analytics for surveillance videos. 

				Video monitoring is common due to security, safety, operational efficiency and 

				business intelligence reasons. The video streams can be analyzed to provide 

				additional insight that is relevant to the business. Post event videos are also 

				analyzed where it is difficult for a human operator to review the large amount 

				of data.<br>

				Challenge:<br>&nbsp;

				Develop a script to count people traffic by analyzing a video (.mp4) file.

				The video will show a number of people passing in and out of an entrance.<br>

				The script should provide the following:<br>

				• Count number of people entered and exited, keeping a record of it<br>

				• Keep record of time of entry and exit.<br>

				Evaluation Criteria:

				To qualify,<br>

				• Minimum 95% of Entries/Exits should be recognized<br>

				• Of these, 95% should be accurately classified between Entries/Exits<br>

				• False positives not more than 10%.<br>

				• Final Evaluation will be done on video different from a sample video <br>

				given<br>

				Additional Considerations:<br>&nbsp;

				• Programmers can use freely available libraries and software, provided 

				they give clear references to all<br>

				• Length of video may vary between 10 min to 14 hours. A typical 1-hour 

				video will be around 1GB in size with 3 frames per seconds.<br>

				• Programmer is provided a sample video to test their program. (File size 

				is 170MB) (Download Video)<br>

				• The traffic from Channel 4 in the video stream is to be analyzed.<br>

				Deadline: 31st October<br>
