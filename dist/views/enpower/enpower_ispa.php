<h1>Institute Summer Project Allocation</h1>

Society for Promotion of Undergraduate Research (SPUR) has been transformed into Engineering oriented Promotion of Work(EnPoWER) as an initiative of the General Secretary of Academic Affairs(UG) '13-'14. Building upon the initiative of ISPA by SPUR last year, Institute Summer Project Allocation (ISPA) ’13 is being launched. Currently, many students approach Professors for a summer project as summer provides ample amount of time to delve into the wonderful world of research. ISPA has been undertaken to centralise this process of project allocation for the convenience of both Professors and the students. It also aims at encouraging students to take research experience beyond their own department by launching Inter-Department Projects. As it’s name says, EnPoWER wishes to build a culture of UG participation in innovative Engineering activities and thus also provide opportunities to do project under TREELabs and student bodies like Technovation this year. 

Go through the Rule Book very carefully before applying. In case of any queries, feel free to drop in a mail to Keshav Kumar isaa.enpower@gmail.com 

A very special thanks to all the faculty members & DAMP Teams for their kind support towards this. We hope you, the students, make the most of it! 

Here's to a researchful summer! 
Cheers! 
Team ISPA 2013.
