<h3>MBA Scholarships</h3><br>
For the majority of MBA students, funding the cost of their chosen programme will mean digging into hard earned savings, pulling in favours from sympathetic relatives, or taking out some form of loan. However, for a lucky minority, a scholarship can make all the difference to the business school experience.
According to Rose Martinelli, Dean of Admissions at Chicago GSB, USA, “Every year there are millions of dollars of unclaimed scholarships for MBA and graduate education, often from government agencies which have no marketing budgets to promote their schemes. Applicants have to search out these scholarships.” But where do you start?<br><br>

<h3>School scholarships</h3><br>
 Many business schools award their own scholarships to outstanding MBA candidates and your chosen school should consequently be your first port of call. These scholarships vary in amount and normally take the form of fee remission, with some including contributions to living expenses. Qualification criteria vary from school to school, but the most common are nationality, academic excellence or, the all-embracing term, merit. Lauren Tracey, Financial Aid Director at Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University explains: “We offer merit scholarships, which require no separate financial aid application. Simply put, the admission application alone makes applicants eligible for consideration for a merit scholarship.” In 2004, 76% of full-time MBA students were awarded institutional grants or scholarship awards at Tepper, Carnegie Mellon. Their awards ranged from US$2,500 to the full tuition cost.
Another US school, University of Chicago GSB, offers scholarships to approximately 30% of the incoming MBA class each year. These are available to US citizens and international students. Candidates are automatically considered for a scholarship if admitted to the MBA program. Recent graduates applying to Harvard Business School are eligible to apply for Frank Knox Fellowships, while international candidates securing a place at the University of Pennsylvania are eligible to apply for Thuron Scholarships. In Europe, London Business School and INSEAD communicate their scholarship portfolio to successful candidates, when they have been offered a place.<br>
Business schools increasingly seek to create truly international classes by encouraging applications from countries where there is little or no tradition of management education, or where the cost of studying abroad would be prohibitive. As a result, scholarships targeted at participants from particular countries is becoming more common. The business school of the University of South Dakota, for example, offers a US$5,000 scholarship for students originating in East Asia, while Edinburgh Business School, UK has developed four scholarships for applicants from South America and Africa. Other schools use scholarships to improve student diversity in a different way. The Indian School of Business has two awards sponsored by the Anand Group and Novartis, which are only available to women. Northeastern University College of Business Administration, USA has the Martin Luther King Jr Graduate Fellowship to attract students from the African-American community. Details of scholarships offered by over 200 major schools are available through the online selection tool, Scorecard, which allows potential MBAs to search and evaluate programmes depending on their personal aims, abilities and circumstances.

Companies and charitable institutions Schools, however, are not the only source of scholarships. In recent years, some enlightened employers have developed scholarship programmes to support potential students from within their ranks. Iain Corby, a consultant at the London office of Deloitte, received funding from the firm for an MBA program at UCLA, California, despite the fact that scholarships were normally only available for European study at the time. “It took some negotiation,” he says, “but the firm eventually accepted my case that the school and the specialisms it could offer were right for me.”<br><br>

<h3>Charitable institutions </h3>
also provide a wide range of scholarships. Fulbright Awards, for example, offer academic achievers help finance study in the USA. Grants are awarded on the basis of academic merit and professional promise. Over 140 countries participate in the program and 51 bi-national commissions have been established. The Rotary Foundation’s Ambassadorial Scholarships is the world’s largest privately funded international scholarships program awarding more than 1,100 scholarships to candidates from 64 countries for study in 69 countries. Awards total approximately US$26 million.<br><br>

<h3>Rotary International Scholarship</h3><br>
Christian Kanu obtained a Rotary International Scholarship to pursue an MBA at Cranfield, UK. He advises, “In order to enhance your chances of getting a scholarship, be informed about all scholarships and try to be better or different from the other applicants.” Michel Berthelin received a US$22,000 two-year Rotary scholarship to study for an MBA at Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University and offers pointed advice. “My feeling is that people who stand a good chance in general of getting a scholarship have the following characteristics: they have set clear goals for their careers, they express a strong desire to meet other cultures, they understand the ideals of the Rotary Foundation and they are genuinely looking for ways to contribute to a better world.”<br><br>

<h3>World MBA Tour</h3><br>
One of the newest sources of scholarships is the international business school information fair, the World MBA Tour. In addition to meeting Admissions Directors of over 300 of the world’s top business schools, candidates who visit the World MBA Tour in 2006 will qualify to apply for over US$1,300,000 of exclusive scholarships. Partner schools offering scholarships during 2006, include: The Wharton School, Politecnico di Milano, Instituto de Empresa, Nijenrode and Ashridge Business School.<br><br>

Raluca had studied at Bentley College, US where she graduated Magna Cum Laude. She then combined work experience assisting experienced executives in contract negotiations, as well as mentoring under privileged children in her spare time.<br><br>

<h3>QS Scholarships</h3><br>
QS, the organiser of the fairs, offer seven scholarships of their own, for study at any major institution. Winners of the QS Scholarships for 2005, who were selected from over 900 applicants, included nationals of Hungary, India, Mexico, South Korea, Switzerland and the USA. According to the scholarship sponsors, Nunzio Quacquarelli and Matt Symonds of QS, the purpose of the awards is to enable talented individuals to attend leading business or graduate schools so that they may acquire further skills in leadership, teamwork and corporate governance and thereby be able to change and make a meaningful difference to the world. The selection panel also try to ensure geographic diversity in the mix of winners.
One of the early winners was Nadja Specht, who has just completed her MBA at the Goizueta Business School at Emory University in Atlanta. Whilst working in Munich as a management consultant with Accenture, at the age of 26, Nadja successfully led an international client team of eight individuals from France, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands during a post-merger integration. “The QS scholarship has made a big difference to my life. I now have a great MBA and can stay and work in the US.”<br><br>
