The student shall be working on one of them under sir's M.Tech or PhD student.,Must have done a steel design course (CE308) and got BB or above grade in it. He/she should also know structural optimization.
Prof. Monika Jain,Design guidelines and intelligent management of green buildings,"During the summer, the student will work with me to conduct a detailed survey of selected buildings on campus to collect data on space usage, building materials and design, energy usage and water usage. The student will also help in choosing and installing smart sensors in these buildings to monitor in real-time, energy use, temperature, humidity and air quality. We will also simulate the building performance to understand how various parameters influence the energy usage in the buildings using one of the energy modeling softwares available in my lab.","•CPI >= 7.5;
•2nd and 3rd year undergrads and 2nd, 3rd and 4th year dual degree (students who at least have one more year at IIT)
•Desired skills/software: Experience with building modeling software (autocad, sketchup or any other) and energy modeling software (energy plus, DOE, Sefaira, etc.),  Matlab or similar software, data analysis software skills
•Additional: Interest in surveying and measurements of buildings"
