Prof. Monika Jain,Design guidelines and intelligent management of green buildings,"During the summer, the student will work with me to conduct a detailed survey of selected buildings on campus to collect data on space usage, building materials and design, energy usage and water usage. The student will also help in choosing and installing smart sensors in these buildings to monitor in real-time, energy use, temperature, humidity and air quality. We will also simulate the building performance to understand how various parameters influence the energy usage in the buildings using one of the energy modeling softwares available in my lab.","•CPI >= 7.5;
•2nd and 3rd year undergrads and 2nd, 3rd and 4th year dual degree (students who at least have one more year at IIT)
•Desired skills/software: Experience with building modeling software (autocad, sketchup or any other) and energy modeling software (energy plus, DOE, Sefaira, etc.),  Matlab or similar software, data analysis software skills
•Additional: Interest in surveying and measurements of buildings"

Prof. Varsha Apte,Automated grading,This project is about implementing an Automated Grading system that can be used to grade assignments (among other things) for courses in IIT Bombay. It is an MTP which is being pursued currently. The work will be to coordinate with post graduate students and build the back end code.,2nd and 3rd years can apply. A programming test is going to be conducted for those who apply.
Prof. Varsha Apte,Automated Grading (design),This project is about build a front end for the Automated Grading system that is being implemented (by the same Prof). The work is to build an attractive and elegant web design for the online Automated grading system,2nd and 3rd years can apply. A programming test (more design oriented) will be conducted for those who apply.
Kameswari Chebrolu,E-learning Platform,"Build a ""Khan Academy / Coursera"" style website for hosting technical content targeted towards Indian students from other engineering colleges.
This is advanced web development involving tracking student progress, supporting quizzes etc. Two fourth year students already worked on the project for a semester. The website is being developed in Django python framework. Looking for motivated students who will continue this ""noble"" work that can potentially have good societal impact. Please do look at the Khan-academy and coursera websites to get an idea of whats involved.",Students with prior experience in web development. Should be highly motivated (no patience for slackers). Skype Interiviews for selection.
Priya Jadhav,Remote voltage monitoring unit with GPRS capability,MSEB has certain Quality of Supply standards for electricity supply which include certain a range of voltage and harmonics levels. We are developing a voltage monitoring unit to measure the adherence to standards in rural areas. Several such units will be placed at various places to record voltage and harmonics levels and transmit the data back to a central server using GPRS. The project involves developing a microcontroller interface to a measurement unit and developing the GSM/GPRS functionality. ,The students who would like to work on this project should have experience with microcontrollers and digital interfaces. Experience with GSM/GPRS is preferable.
Prof. Gautham Mukhyopadhyay,Theoretical Solid State Physics,The student will mostly be given computation and mathematical challenges in solid-state physics. The exact topic of the project can be discussed with the professor after being selected.,"1. Good CPI
2. Knowledge of MATLAB/computing devices is preferred
3. Needs to be a fast learner
4. Needs to be very sincere and hard-working

K G Suresh,Study of Half metallic feromagnets,"To understand some basic properties of certain half metallic ferro magnets.
These have applications in spintronics.",Physics and Electrical Students only
M.P. Gururajan,Opencl Programming for Microstructural Evolution,"Microstructural evolution codes are, in general, codes written to solve partial differential equations. They can be, and in most cases of interest and importance, are, quite intensive computationally. Hence, GPU based parallel programming techniques are quite useful to study microstructural evolution numerically. In this project, students are expected to solve coupled, non-linear diffusion equations (for mass and heat) using opencl based programs.",Good programming skills; interview will be taken if there are many students.
Shobha Shukla,Extracting co-ordinates from 2D/3D image and contrlling xyz piezostage,"In this project extraction of co-ordinates will be done from 2D/3D image using any programming language or software. Then, this information will be used for precisely controlling xyz piezostage and high speed shutter for laser photo-lithography using labview.",BTech 2nd/3rd year/MSc and proficient in labview
