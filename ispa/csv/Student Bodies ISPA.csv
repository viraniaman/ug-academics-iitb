Technovation Team,Artificial Instrumentalist ,"We are trying to create real-life models of these instruments, currently targeting a drum and guitar playing robot based on ""Future Retro"", resembling a  robotic band playing any music file feeded of choice.","Mech: CADing, fabrication, testing and simulation of the prototype"
Technovation Team,Artificial Instrumentalist ,,Elec Profile: Circuitry for controlling actuators and working on a new control system
Technovation Team,Artificial Instrumentalist ,,"Coding Profile:Drum Beat Transcription & Interface development, integration with bot"
Technovation Team,Campus Transport Tracking System,Design a system that tracks moving vehicles within a space and gets the location approximately in real time. This system will be modified and adapted for the Tum-Tums in the institute.Prototype is ready for testing,Software: Uploading data(bus position information) to database so that can be fetched and used by android and web application: good with PHP and Databases
Technovation Team,Campus Transport Tracking System,,"Electronics: Arduino with Ethernet module to directly upload in database,PCB designing and circuit testing: PCB designing skills + Circuit debugging"
Technovation Team,BlindSight,Our idea is to develop a unique ‘sixth sense’ which will enable a blind person to be able to navigate in the real world with relative ease.,"Basic elec / coding background , prior experience with microcontrollers and sensors [preferred, but not compulsory]  and are enthusiastic about the project"
Technovation Team,Dental Curing Torch ,"If you ever had a dental cavity, and you got it treated upon, you would quickly understand what is being talked about. In most cases, a dentist uses a resin material (or a silver material), to fill in a dental cavity. The resin material is semi-solid in its original form. This material is hardened (cured) by projecting a light of particular wavelength (in this case, blue colour) on it, for less than a minute. The process is called photo-polymerizatoin. The proposed project is to design a dental curing torch. The task would involve a) driver circuits (for constant current source), b) charging circuit (battery operated device), c) optics (for achieving desired focus and intensity) d) encapsulation design (water proof, sterilizable)",cpi
