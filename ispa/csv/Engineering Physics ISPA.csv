Prof. Gautham Mukhyopadhyay,Theoretical Solid State Physics,The student will mostly be given computation and mathematical challenges in solid-state physics. The exact topic of the project can be discussed with the professor after being selected.,"1. Good CPI
2. Knowledge of MATLAB/computing devices is preferred
3. Needs to be a fast learner
4. Needs to be very sincere and hard-working
5. A report needs to be submitted, which will be graded by the professor"
