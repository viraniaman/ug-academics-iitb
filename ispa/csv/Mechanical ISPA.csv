R.P.Vedula,Modeling a multi cylinder piston pump,The piston pump is a positive displacement pump which has application in various industrial processes. The geometry of the pump has to be understood and the equations for each pisoton written and all equations integrated to generate the volume flow rate and pressure at the  pump exit. A set of differential equations will be obtained which have to be solved numerically.,Any MED student
