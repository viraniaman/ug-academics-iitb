V M Gadre,,"This project is to evolve an uncertainty like principle in a signal detection problem, involving chirp signals. For the past two summers, this project has been given to summer students under SPAS and differential progress made. This summer, we wish to take the next step: read about the uncertainty principle in the Fractional Fourier domain, investigate whether it can be generalized fora general 'Fractional' domain. A student who takes this project will also have to: (i) do some routine simulations using SciLab/ Matlab after getting familiarity (ii) help in some educational documentation as a common activity given to all students working with me.","[ 2, atmost 3 students] Selection process: Exam and Interviews"
Bipin Rajendran,,"Biological neurons behave in a very counterintuitive and surprising manner: For a noisy input, the behavior is deterministic, and for a clean dc input, the behavior is very noisy. We will simulate the basic dynamics of the neuron using MATLAB or C to come up with a model that explains this. The final goal will be to build logic circuits using nanoscale devices that are faulttolerant based on similar algorithmic principles.","1 student, CPI+Interview"

S. B. Pillai,Synchronizing a few transmitters and receiver over the air. ,"Imagine a few users trying to synchronize with a receiver/basestation. Using digital signal processing and communication techniques, we have to design a synch scheme. The hardware is supplied by software radio boxes (built in FPGA), and the project envisages developing a block in the popular GNURADIO platform which will do the synchronization.

S. B. Pillai,Finding the average delay in a queue with incentives (Theoretical). ,"Often we are faced with queuing systems. Imagine a queue in which customers arrive with unit sized work requirements. There is one mainserver where they queue up, but this is not the old times where people will stand just like that. They also get served, say by other means, at a lower rate though. Suppose the customer at position i gets served at a rate s_i, where s_i decreases with i. What is the average time a job spends in the system, if the arrivals are according to a Poisson process. Notice that nobody will leave without finishing its job requirement, as eventually he/she will reach the mainserver, gets the remaining job done and then leaves. (An alternative name for this is multiprocessor scheduling with SRPT FM, i.e. shortest job to the fastest machine) [ 1-2 students ]","2 STUDENTS:Selection process: 1.

Deepak Malani (Phd student under Virendra Sule),Dental Curing Torch ,"""If you ever had a dental cavity, and you got it treated upon, you would quickly understand what is being talked about. In most cases, a dentist uses a resin material (or a silver material), to fill in a dental cavity. The resin material is semi-solid in its original form. This material is hardened (cured) by projecting a light of particular wavelength (in this case, blue colour) on it, for less than a minute. The process is called photo-polymerizatoin. The proposed project is to design a dental curing torch. The task would involve a) driver circuits (for constant current source), b) charging circuit (battery operated device), c) optics (for achieving desired focus and intensity) d) encapsulation design (water proof, sterilizable)""",cpi

S. V. Kulkarni,Mathematical modelling of magnetic hysteresis in transformers ,"Magnetic circuit of a transformer, made from steel laminations, exhibits nonlinear and hysteretic characteristics. A precise mathematical model should consider these characteristics. Some major challenges associated with any formulation dealing with the problem are convergence issues and high computational time. The project involves the measurement of hysteresis loop of the core materials using Epstein tester. The measured hysteresis loop can be linearlized mathematically using a complex permeability approach. The approach can be useful in assessing the performance of the magnetic circuit and/or in diagnosing its condition.","sophie+thirdie, CPI>8.0 , "
