R. C. Prasad,"1) Testing of ""Fracture toughness"" for steels used in ship building","The above mentioned project involves testing of mechanical properties of concerned materials and their microstructural analysis. Student will work with Phd or Mtech students under guidance of professor.  
Note 1: Professor is not sure about his stay in IIT during summer... In case if he has to leave for some reason, he will let DAMP's know.
Note 2: Students doing above project cannot make information public, as this is industry assigned project. Students can mention this project's work experience in their resume only if their performance is satisfactory.
","Project require understanding of wide range of metal testings.
So, students without backlogs would be preferred. Student with active backlogs can also apply and selection will be done on the basis of their knowledge and interest. First year students are not eligible to apply.

N. Venkataramani,Cordless Charging of Electrical Power,"This project has been inspired from tram in Korean Institute of Technology. This train uses inductive methods to get its power. At itâ€™s heart, the technology uses inductive coupling to wirelessly transmit electricity from power cables embedded in roadways to pick-up coils installed under the floor of electric vehicles. To device the same setup in Laboratory.

The project will be supervised directly by the Professor.",Enthusiasm in student is a pre requisite for filling up the project.
N. Venkataramani,Manganite Thin Films,"Deposition and characterization of PCMO (PRASEODYMIUM CALCIUM MANGANESE OXIDE) thin films. Collecting the data and all the physical as well as chemical properties of the thin film such as resistivity and resistive switching properties. Analyze the data using various tools and equipments available. Vickers indentation of the thin film.

This project is very precious, and has lots of scope. The student will have to work in coordination with Prof. Venkataramani and a M. Tech student.","A highly enthusiastic student, with research interest will be given preference. Should not ditch the project in between, as Prof. Venkataramani has taken very much personal interest."
M.P. Gururajan,Opencl Programming for Microstructural Evolution,"Microstructural evolution codes are, in general, codes written to solve partial differential equations. They can be, and in most cases of interest and importance, are, quite intensive computationally. Hence, GPU based parallel programming techniques are quite useful to study microstructural evolution numerically. In this project, students are expected to solve coupled, non-linear diffusion equations (for mass and heat) using opencl based programs.",Good programming skills; interview will be taken if there are many students.
Prof. Prita Pant,Coke vs. Pepsi (comparing strength of cans used for Coke and Pepsi),"Open up Coke can and Pepsi can and find a way of doing tensile test for each. Then if there are differences, try to find out the causes behind differences",Should have completed at least 1st year of engineering
Shobha Shukla,Extracting co-ordinates from 2D/3D image and contrlling xyz piezostage,"In this project extraction of co-ordinates will be done from 2D/3D image using any programming language or software. Then, this information will be used for precisely controlling xyz piezostage and high speed shutter for laser photo-lithography using labview.",BTech 2nd/3rd year/MSc and proficient in labview
Shobha Shukla,Two-photon photo lithography of nanostructures,Femto-second laser will be used for writing polymeric composite nanostructure utilizing non-linear interation of ultrafast laser and material. Various nanostructures will be fabricated using this bottom-up photochemical approach.,"BTech 3rd year, MSc, basic knowledge of optics is desirable"
Sumit Saxena,First Principles simulation of graphene base materials,First principle techniques (Density functional theory/ time dependent density functional theory) will be used to determine electronic properties of graphene based materails along with development of code for cleaving crystals along different planes and constructing unit or supercells along particular crystal axis.,"Dual Degree student (3rd year onwards) / M.Sc. basic understanding of physics (solid state/ condensed matter) , "
