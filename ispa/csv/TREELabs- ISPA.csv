Prof Dipankar,Telescope,"a 12-14 inch telescope with motorized mounts / tracking and computer interface to acquire images. Web-enabled. We plan to make as much from scratch as possible, including making glass blanks (furnace to create glass), grinding (with home-made CNC machine) mirror, robust mechanical mounts - robotic / power-steerable, etc.",Great Enthusiasm to work on their own
Prof Dipankar,Electric Bicycles ,build electric bicycles that may be used on our campus.,
Prof Dipankar,Scanning Tunneling Microscope ,"build STM that would allow viewing atoms. This is cutting edge technology, and one could build such systems",
Prof Dipankar,Solar electric paramotor ,"build an electric motor based paraglider. The aim will be to create an aircraft that does not require fossil fuel, is compact enough to pack in your bag, yet one can take-off and land from a flat surface.",
Prof Dipankar,"""Click-Click"" algorithm",bridging the digital divide,
Prof Dipankar,Building high-efficiency water pumps,,
Prof Dipankar,Low-water irrigation / permaculture applications,Normal surface water irrigation results in a lot of loss due to evaporation.,
Prof Dipankar,Electric wheelchair ,"user interface can have various options, depending upon the patient's need. From voice operated to making it follow your eyes, etc., the possibilities are many.",
Prof Dipankar,PCB etching machine,". Normal PCB (printed circuit  boards) are made with etching copper with Ferric Chloride or similar etchant. The copper goes in solution as copper ions, and is a loss, in addition to being environmentally unfriendly. The present scheme would try to recover copper, and not require continuous supply of etchant.",
Prof Dipankar,Graphic braille tablet ,Graphic braille tablet for the visually handicapped,
Prof Dipankar,blind-fold navigation,Vibrating belt for blind-fold navigation. One could also equip with various ultrasound,
Prof Dipankar,Power Supply,"Build power supplies and battery chargers with input energy from a variety of sources - from common mains to small units based on small wind-mills, vibration energy harvesters, etc.",
Prof Dipankar,Laser Communication,"Free-space laser communication link. Modulate a diode laser beam to send audio signals / voice communication, etc. Make spy-voice recorders !",
Prof Dipankar,Night Vision Telescope,Build a night-vision telescope (using binoculars and illuminating a distant place using IR LEDs). The received image is read back on an IR CCD.,
Prof Dipankar,Magnetic Globe,Magnetically suspended globe. One could also make the globe interactive,
Prof Dipankar,Pyrometer,"Webcam based optical pyrometer. By looking at a heated objects optical radiation, using a webcam, determine its temperature",
Prof Dipankar,Musical Lights,"creative patterns based on LEDs, Lasers, galvanometers, etc to create interesting optical displays, in sync with audio inputs. (Sound and light show)",
