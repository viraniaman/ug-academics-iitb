Mahesh S Tirumkudulu,Writing ImageJ plugin software for particle detection and tracking,"mageJ is a freely available image processing software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). We want to use the software to identify particles and track their movement. While a number of  particle tracking plugins for ImageJ are available, we would like to modify them for our work. This is a coding project and the student is expected to have a strong background in programming.

Mahesh S Tirumkudulu,Understanding the motion of tippe-top: Experiments and Modeling,"Tippe Top is a special spinning top which inverts on being rotated at high angular velocities (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tippe_top). The dynamics of this top has fascinated scientists (including Neils Bohr and Wolfgang Pauli) over the last century with a number of theoretical models explaining the intriguing behavior. One of the main outcomes of the theories is that the roughness of the solid surface on which the top rotates is crucial for the inversion, though it appears that this fact has not been validated with experiments. The objective of the project is to investigate the aforementioned prediction using surfaces of varying roughnesses. The top's motion will be recorded using a high speed camera and various characteristics of the motion will be quantified. Depending on the available time, the student could also attempt to model the top's motion. "
