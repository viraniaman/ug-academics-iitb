Deepak Malani Ph.D student under Virendra Singh,Dental Curing Torch,"If you ever had a dental cavity, and you got it treated upon, you would quickly understand what is being talked about.
In most cases, a dentist uses a resin material (or a silver material), to fill in a dental cavity.
The resin material is semi-solid in its original form. 
This material is hardened (cured) by projecting a light of particular wavelength (in this case, blue colour) on it, for less than a minute. The process is called photo-polymerizatoin.

The proposed project is to design a dental curing torch.
The task would involve 
a) driver circuits (for constant current source), 
b) charging circuit (battery operated device),
c) optics (for achieving desired focus and intensity)
d) encapsulation design (water proof, sterilizable)

Ishutesh Jain Ph.D student under Ranjith Padinhateeri,Theoretical Study of Tip Structure of Microtubules.,"This project is a Theoretical/Computational study which is set to understand the physics of Microtubules(MT) tip (see below for details). We will be applying techniques from statistical mechanics to understand the MT's tip structure and dynamics. This involve writing computer codes and doing massive simulations. Although, this project is motivated from a biological point, the tools used here are commonly applied to understand properties of various complex systems (from polymers to financial market!).

About Project: Microtubules(MT) are tubular filament assemblies inside the cell that participate in cell division, transportation within the cell and various other cellular movements. They are the targets of most anti-cancer drugs which usually manipulate its dynamical properties. Also, there are several other 'regulatory' proteins which work similarly. It has been observed that dynamics of MT can be regulated by changing the properties of its 'tip'. Most of the MT targeting molecules (anti-cancer drugs and regulatory proteins) are speculated to work in this fashion.

Gelli Ravikumar Ph.D student under Prof. S. A. Khaparde,Development of web enabled CIM oriented power system applications,"(1) Brief introduction: Common information model is a power system domain data standard, which defines semantics for all power system resources. To date, the existing systems are in proprietary in nature and it leads to interoperability issues. Therefore, there is an ample scope for developing CIM oriented applications for power systems.
(2) Work status:
The work is under progress, and there is a scope for carrying work by UGs. I will define the work that to be carried by the students (UGs once assigned). For your information, in brief, the work will be implementing the algorithms pertaining to power system applications (I’ll explain up to granularity). Presently, we are doing web enabled (or cloud based) software system for providing services kind to the power engineers. So, the work involves writing programs with web technologies (both server and client side). So, students should be well comfortable with web technologies.
(3) Opportunity:
The work will be greatly suitable to provide opportunity for CSE students. Opportunity is available for at max three students only for carrying this research work.

Gelli Ravikumar Ph.D student under Prof. S. A. Khaparde,Development of web enabled Dispatcher Training Simulator (DTS),"Brief Introduction: A dispatcher training simulator (DTS), also known as an operator training simulator, is a computer-based training system for operators (known as dispatchers) of electrical power grids. It performs this role by simulating the behaviour of the electrical network forming the power system under various operating conditions, and its response to actions by the dispatchers. Student dispatchers may therefore develop their skills from exposure not only to routine operations but also to adverse operational situations without compromising the security of supply on a real transmission system [source: wiki].
Work to be carried:
Students need to implement the existing algorithms for power systems applications pertaining to DTS. The work involves writing programs with web technologies (both server and client side)

Rahi  Ph.D student under Bakul Rao,Analysis of diagnostic technologies used for detection of bacterial diseases in India.,"The project involves visiting to various rural and urban area (in and around Mumbai) health centers, diagnostic centers and hospitals to understand the the process of performing diagnosis of bacterial diseases including the technologies used in the process. The identified technologies needs to be compared and analyzed using multi-criteria decision making tool, namely Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP).The multiple criteria will involve parameters from techno-socio-economic domain.
