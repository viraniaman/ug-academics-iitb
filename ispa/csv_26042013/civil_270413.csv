Dasaka Murty,Working with earth pressure sensors,"Earth pressure sensors are increasingly being used to measure the earth pressures in
the soil or at soil-structure interface. Calibration of pressure sensors play an
important role in the understanding of the pressure sensed by the sensor. The
student is expected to understand the available calibration procedures and help the
research student in his experimental work.",CPI of the students should be more than 8
Nagendra Rao Velaga,Taxi/Auto Sharing: Towards Flexible and Integrated Transport,"Flexible transport provides certain level of
flexibility in choosing the route, time of travel etc. Example of such
flexible transport is a pre-booked taxi service. However, the cost of such
flexible transport is relatively high. Shared taxi/auto could be an
economic solution with slightly lower level of flexibility. Further, the
shared taxies could be integrated with other modes of transport such as
trains, buses etc. This would be one of the sustainable solutions to the
transport problems in urban India. The main aim of this mini project is to
identify issues with development of a flexible and integrated transport
system through Taxi/Auto sharing. The work involves interacting with
passengers and service providers and also conducting surveys.
