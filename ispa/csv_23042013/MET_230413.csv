Prof. Somnath Basu,Feasibility of producing low P steel from DRI using induction furnace,"Use of P2O5 bearing iron ores in iron making leads to production high P hot metal either from blast furnace or COREX. Conversion of this hot metal to low P steel, in a BOF or EAF, is difficult and is associated with problems like excess lime consumption and large volume of slag generation. Conversion of DRI into liq steel in induction furnace takes place at lower temperature. This lower temperature which is considered to be thermodynamically favorable for dephosphorization of liq hot metal. However, induction furnaces are usually lined with acidic refractory, which is believed to be detrimental for de-P. This project would investigate the influence of the temperature, slag composition and other operating parameters so as to optimize the extent of de-P, which will essentially be compromise between benefit of low temperature and detrimental effect of acidic refractory.","any student of mems department, only 1 student for the project"
