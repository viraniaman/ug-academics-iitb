Prof Dhananjay M. Dhamdhere,Program analysis for dynamic software updates (DSU),A trace that facilitates DSU has been designed in a BTP. This project concerns its implementation and performance testing. The work involves data flow analysis of a program,Number of students: 2; Eligibility: btech3 students; Duration: 8 weeks starting first week of May. Selection: Resume + Interview.
PB,Sentiment Analysis," Detecting people's opinion on social network and blogs has become very important these days. For example, movies, products, companies, actors, professors and many others with people's interaction need to know what others think about them. Ignorance on this front can be inconvenient at best and disastrous at worst. The project aims to use machine learning and rules based techniques for recognizing sentiment of users. ",Good programming skill and grip of probability and statistics is required.
PB,Shallow Processing of Natural Language," Language contains meaning and the ultimate objective of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is to decipher meaning of text. Systems like WATSON, SIRI which are a rage these days, use elaborate mechanism for automatically understanding text. However, there are intermediate steps towards this goal. Words have to be broken down to their elements, their categories determined, phrases detected and so on. Again one needs both rule based and machine learning methods for doing this task. The project aims to do this. ","Good programming skill, probability and statistics and sense of language are the eligibility criteria for the project.

I will prefer interview based selection"
G. Sivakumar ,Multimedia Presentation Authoring tools," Visit http://slides.html5rocks.com/  to see how
HTML5/CSS3/Javascript
can be used
        for creating interactive presentations with multimedia.
          Other frameworks like reveal.js and impress.js are also in vogue.
         This project will build an authoring tool to create such web based
presentations
          including synchronized audio (speech) with slides and animation.","Any one who has written any interesting code on their own is eligible.
Preferable if they have done a course in Data Structures & Algorithms.
CPI/Department are not the considerations.
Motivation and self-learning capability are the prime requirements."
G. Sivakumar ,Browser-based (SVG) tool for Teaching Automata and Logic," JFLAP  http://www.jflap.org/  is one example of a tool built
using
      Java for teaching automata to CS undergrads. The current approach
would be
      to use SVG support available in HTML5 and  Responsive Web Design
techniques
      to make a completely browser-based system for learning Automata and
Logic.
      This project is to design and build such a tool.

Interview those shortlisted on the basis of resume and a 1-page statement
about why they want to work on these projects.

G. Sivakumar ,Dynamic PDF document generation with Indic scripts,"  http://itextpdf.com/  (Itext) is one example of a
        library that allows developers to enhance web- and other
applications
        with dynamic PDF document generation.
        However, it does not work well for Indian languages.
        This project will study & enhance current approaches.","Any one who has written any interesting code on their own is eligible.

G. Sivakumar ,Integrating Biometric Data with IIT-B ASC applications.,"T Bombay's Application Software Cell has developed many
        web based applications including for Academic activities
        using JBoss platform. This project has 2 goals-
          1. To integrate the Biometric attendance data with
                exisiting ASC applications.
          2. Explore other frameworks line  node.js (http://nodejs.org)
             for developing such applications and enhancements for using it
             for student elections, admissions to PAF, MoodI.","Skills needed: Software development skills in networks and sockets.
        They should also have good programming skills in c++, Java & sql."
Sundar Vishwanathan,Algorithmic problems,"Proposed group of 3. researching solutions to open-ended algorithmic problems. With meeting approx thrice in a week(at max). Quoting Sir- ""This is not a project as such. I (SIR) will not be able to make any contribution unless you(students) make a progress and show some initiatives of our own. It may happen that you may not be able to solve any question throughout the period but that's how it goes.""",2nd/3rd year students.
