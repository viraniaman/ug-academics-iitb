Prof. K. P. Karunakaran,Coaxial Rotor Helicopter,This is in-line with Professor's vision to develop a tail-less helicopter. The ultimate (long term) goal is to develop a compact helicopter that can serve as a personal transport vehicle. Project is at an advanced stage and testing is expected to start at May end. Work mainly involves mechanical system design and fabrication. ,"Student must be passionate, sincere and willing to put in effort. Knowledge of CAD software (specially Pro-E) is a plus. "
Prof. K. P. Karunakaran,Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV),"The Micro Aerial Vehicle in question here is a Tricopter with three pairs of contra-rotating blades. This project is much more difficult than the conventional quadcopter due to the challenging task of stabilizing its flight. Project also involves working on the electronics on the MAV (Microcontroller board, sensors and motor controllers). ","Student must be passionate, sincere and willing to put in effort. Some prior knowledge of control systems, electronic system design is a plus. (Electrical engg. Student encouraged to apply)"
Prof. K. P. Karunakaran,DelCAM,DelCAM is a CAD/CAM software tool. There is an existing code in C++ that does a certain 'slicing' operation on CAD models. It is desired to rewrite this software using DelCAM's API and thus integrate this functionality into the package. ,"Student must be passionate, sincere and willing to put in effort and learn. Some prior knowledge of DelCAM (or any other CAD/CAM software) would be an advantage. Basic knowledge of C and C++ is a must. "
Prof. Kannan Moudgalya,Java Programming for improving the Big Blue Button Software,The project involves coding in Java language to improve the open source software Big Blue Button.,Knowledge of Java
Prof. Kannan Moudgalya,Text book Companion,The students will code solved problems of standard textbooks of Science and Technology in Scilab or Python or Open Foam,Students are expected to learn either of these three software quicly with the provided instruction material.
Prof. Kannan Moudgalya,A GNU Radio based replacement of LabView,"Coding in C,C++ and Python.A honorarium may be provided.","People should be comfortable with Linux,Python,C and C++. This is for students who want to contribute not for students who want to learn."
Prof. Kannan Moudgalya,"Oscad- an integrated  electronic circuit design package, developed at IIT Bombay","looking for summer interns who are good in and passionate about 
electronic circuits.  Python programming would be an asset, as the GUI 
is based on Python.  One can learn Python through spoken tutorials 
available at http://spoken-tutorial.org.",
